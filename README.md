**Meet1**
>is an app that allows users to view upcoming events by city, ensuring that they never miss a concert again.
>
**Objective:**
>To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

**Frontend**
>Written with JavaScript/React; hosted on GitHub Pages.
**Backend (Server Logic)**
>Written with Node/Express as Lambda functions (FaaS); hosted on AWS (requests come from frontend to Lambda function to data).
**Backend (Database)** 
>Google Calendar API.
**Key Features**
>Filter events by city
>Show/hide event details
>Specify number of events
>Use the app when offline
>Add an app shortcut to the home screen
>View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city 
**User Stories**
>**Feature 1: EVENT FILTERING**
	>Scenario 1: Show upcoming events from all cities
		>Given the user hasn’t searched for any city
		>When the user views the list of events
		>Then the user should see all upcoming events
	>Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions
		>when they search for a city
		>Given the main page is open When the user starts typing in the city text box
		>Then the user should see a list of cities that match their search
	>Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list
		>Given the user was typing "Berlin" in the city text box and the list of suggested cities is showing
		>When the user selects a city from the list
		>Then their city should be set to „Berlin"
>**Feature 2: SHOW/HIDE AN EVENT'S DETAILS**
	>Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default
		>Given the list of events is open
		>When the user views the events
		>Then each event element should be collapsed
	>Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see its details
		>Given the list of events is open
		>When the user clicks on an event
		>Then the event details should be displayed
	>Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide its details
		>Given the event details are displayed
		>When the user clicks on the event again
		>Then the event details should be hidden
>**Feature 3: SPECIFY NUMBER OF EVENTS**
	>Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 is the default number
		>Given the list of events is open and the user hasn't specified the number of events to display
		>When the list of events is loaded
		>Then the default number of events to display should be 32
	>Scenario 2: User can change the number of events they want to see
		>Given the list of events is open
		>When the user changes the number of events to display
		>Then the number of events displayed should change accordingly
>**Feature: USE THE APP WHEN OFFLINE**
	>Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection
		>Given the user has loaded the app before and is offline
		>When the user views the app
		>Then the app should show the cached data
	>Scenario 2: Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range)
		>Given the user is offline
		>When the user changes the city or time range
		>Then the app should show an error message
>**Feature: DATA VISUALIZATION**
	>Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
	>Given the list of events is open
	>When the user views the event data visualization
	>Then a chart should be displayed showing the number of upcoming events in each city
	
>**Serverless Function**
>To handle the integration with the Google Calendar API a serverless function could be triggered when a user searches for events in a specific city or requests to see event details. The serverless function could then fetch the relevant data from the Google Calendar API and return it to the user.
When a user types a city into the search box, the serverless function could be triggered to fetch only events in that city and return them to the user.
For offline data storage, a serverless function could store event data in a database when the user is online. This way, when the user goes offline, the app can still display cached event data without needing to fetch new data from the API.
>To handle errors that occur when the user is offline or when there is an error fetching data from the API, a serverless function could display an error message and allow the user to retry their action or try again later.
>Finally, a serverless function could be used to generate a chart showing the number of upcoming events in each city.
